# NHL Team Customizable Statistics Application

In this project, I designed an application to organize statistics for a professional hockey team.
The aim of this application is to allow a user to record and update statistics for each player on a team.

As a result, this application is designed to be used by a hockey team to both record and visualize stats for their players.
After statistics have been added by the user for each player, the user can choose to display a table to show 
the players' statistics. The user has the choice to show either skater or goalie stats.
Furthermore, users can easily sort players by a metric of their choice.

I chose this project because I really enjoy data analysis and how it can be applied to  sports statistics.
Furthermore, I wanted to create a project that would be relevant for my future job prospects in data analytics and
data science. Creating an application that takes in and organizes data is a skill that is very important to demonstrate
in the field of data analysis and data science.

Here is some images showing what the application looks like:
